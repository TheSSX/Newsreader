The rapid spread of the disease on board led to criticism of the Japanese authorities just months before Japan is due to host the Olympics.  </p><p>From Wednesday, passengers who tested negative and showed no symptoms were free to leave. Around 500 were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with the rest of those eligible leaving over the next two days. Confirmed cases were to be sent to hospital, while those who shared cabins with infected passengers may still be kept on board. </p><div class="RelatedCoverage_related-coverage-module module RelatedCoverage_two-column"><h4 class="RelatedCoverage_related-coverage-title">Related Coverage</h4><ul><li><a class="RelatedCoverage_item-container RelatedCoverage_black" href="/article/us-china-health-research-analysis/speed-science-the-risks-of-swiftly-spreading-coronavirus-research-idUSKBN20D21S"><div class="RelatedCoverage_related-image" style="background:center / cover no-repeat url(//s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200219&amp;t=2&amp;i=1492433539&amp;r=LYNXMPEG1I1BT&amp;w=175)"></div><div><span class="RelatedCoverage_related-headline">Speed science: The risks of swiftly spreading coronavirus research</span></div></a></li><li><a class="RelatedCoverage_item-container RelatedCoverage_black" href="/article/us-china-health-japan-us-passengers/80-year-old-u-s-couple-smiles-through-virus-quarantine-in-japan-idUSKBN20D22T"><div class="RelatedCoverage_related-image" style="background:center / cover no-repeat url(//s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200219&amp;t=2&amp;i=1492453940&amp;r=LYNXMPEG1I1CF&amp;w=175)"></div><div><span class="RelatedCoverage_related-headline">80-year-old U.S. couple smiles through virus quarantine in Japan</span></div></a></li></ul><div class="RelatedCoverage_more-button" role="button" tabindex="0">See more stories<!-- --> <svg height="7" width="11"><path d="M1 1.493l4.454 3.905 4.546-4" fill="none" stroke="#86888B" stroke-width="1.5"></path></svg></div></div><p>Around half of the passengers and crew are Japanese, and are free to go home once cleared to leave. Other countries have said they will fly passengers home and quarantine them on arrival. The United States flew more than 300 passengers to air bases in California and Texas this week. </p><p>&ldquo;I am very keen to get off this ship,&rdquo; Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters over a social-media link. She was among a group of Australians getting off to catch an evacuation flight back to 14 days of quarantine in the city of Darwin. </p><p>Matthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on board after declining the U.S. evacuation earlier this week, tweeted video of passengers departing with their suitcases. </p><p>&ldquo;Captain wishes &lsquo;Arrivederci&rsquo; to the guests departing the ship today but omits his usual &lsquo;Buon Appetito&rsquo; to those of us who are still awaiting our fates.

The bureaucrats were in charge of everything,&rdquo; he said in a YouTube video. </p><p>Health Minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan&rsquo;s efforts. </p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases,&rdquo; Kato said in a report by state broadcaster NHK. </p><div class="Image_container" tabindex="-1"><figure class="Image_zoom" style="padding-bottom:"><div class="LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark" style="background-image:none"><img src="//s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200219&amp;t=2&amp;i=1492360377&amp;r=LYNXMPEG1I05K&amp;w=20" aria-label="A member of the media approaches a passenger after he walked out from the cruise ship Diamond Princess at Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, Japan February 19, 2020.

The day before, as passengers were being screened, events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class. </p><h3>BETTER DAY IN CHINA </h3><p>In China, the National Health Commission reported 1,749 new cases, the fewest since Jan. 29. There were just 56 new cases outside Hubei, epicentre of the outbreak, down from a peak of 890 on Feb. 3. </p><p>The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to more than 74,000, with 2,004 deaths, three-quarters of them in Wuhan, Hubei&rsquo;s provincial capital, where the virus originated in a market illegally selling wildlife. </p><p>On top of tough steps taken to isolate Hubei, state media reported the province would track down anyone who visited doctors with fever since Jan. 20 or bought over-the-counter cough and fever medication. </p><p>Chinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence that the strict measures are working. Epidemiologists outside China have said in recent days that reports from there are encouraging, but it is still too early to predict whether the epidemic will be contained. </p><p>Chinese officials have been putting on a brave face, saying the economic impact of the virus would be limited and short-term. President Xi Jinping said China could meet its 2020 economic targets. </p><div class="Slideshow_container Slideshow_small Slideshow_standard"><div class="Slideshow_preview-container"><figure><div class="LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark" style="background-image:none"><img src="//s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200219&amp;t=2&amp;i=1492360373&amp;r=LYNXMPEG1I05L"/><div class="LazyImage_image LazyImage_fallback" style="background-image:url(//s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200219&amp;t=2&amp;i=1492360373&amp;r=LYNXMPEG1I05L);background-position:center center;background-color:inherit"></div></div><div class="Slideshow_expand-button" role="button" tabindex="0"><svg height="18px" width="18px" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 18 18" focusable="false"><path d="M16.2928932,1 L12.5,1 C12.2238576,1 12,0.776142375 12,0.5 C12,0.223857625 12.2238576,0 12.5,0 L17.5,0 C17.7761424,0 18,0.223857625 18,0.5 L18,5.5 C18,5.77614237 17.7761424,6 17.5,6 C17.2238576,6 17,5.77614237 17,5.5 L17,1.70710678 L12.8535534,5.85355339 C12.6582912,6.04881554 12.3417088,6.04881554 12.1464466,5.85355339 C11.9511845,5.65829124 11.9511845,5.34170876 12.1464466,5.14644661 L16.2928932,1 Z M1,16.2928932 L5.14644661,12.1464466 C5.34170876,11.9511845 5.65829124,11.9511845 5.85355339,12.1464466 C6.04881554,12.3417088 6.04881554,12.6582912 5.85355339,12.8535534 L1.70710678,17 L5.5,17 C5.77614237,17 6,17.2238576 6,17.5 C6,17.7761424 5.77614237,18 5.5,18 L0.5,18 C0.223857625,18 0,17.7761424 0,17.5 L0,12.5 C0,12.2238576 0.223857625,12 0.5,12 C0.776142375,12 1,12.2238576 1,12.5 L1,16.2928932 Z"></path></svg></div></figure><figcaption class="Slideshow_caption">Slideshow<span class="Slideshow_count"> (12 Images)</span></figcaption><span class="Slideshow_line" style="background:undefined"></span></div></div><p>An international consensus appears to be forming that the economic harm will be limited if the virus is swiftly contained. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a blog post that China&rsquo;s economy would bounce back quickly if the disruptions end soon. </p><p>In a note prepared for an upcoming summit of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, the IMF stuck to its forecast from last month of 3.3% global economic growth for 2020, up from 2.9% last year. But that scenario assumes a quick containment of the virus and a bounce-back later in the year, it said. </p><p>&ldquo;A wider and more protracted outbreak or lingering uncertainty about contagion could intensify supply chain disruptions and depress confidence more persistently, making the global impact more severe,&rdquo; the IMF said in the note. </p><div class="Attribution_container"><div class="Attribution_attribution"><p class="Attribution_content">Reporting by Ryan Woo and Sophie Yu in Beijing; Linda Sieg in Tokyo; Additional reporting by Se Young Lee in Beijing, Brenda Goh and Samuel Shen in Shanghai; Colin Packham in Sydney; Sarah Wu in Hong Kong; Krishna Das in Kuala Lumpur; Josh Smith and Sangmi Cha in Seoul; Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Jan Strupczewski in Brussels and Peter Graff in London; Writing by Michael Perry, Robert Birsel and Peter Graff; Editing by Stephen Coates, Simon Cameron-Moore and Nick Macfie</p></div></div><div class="StandardArticleBody_trustBadgeContainer"><span class="StandardArticleBody_trustBadgeTitle">Our Standards:</span><span class="trustBadgeUrl"><a href="http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></span></div></div>`;
